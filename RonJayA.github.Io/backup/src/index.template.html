I am also proficient in using server backends and developing front ends in Microsoft Access, PowerApps, and other languages.

            <p class="para">I work for Southern Califonia Edison as a Database Development Specialist and have developed applications for the Automation Database, NetComm Center, PCC App, TDRL Tool, Load Roll Tool, DVVC Tracker and Grid Mod Tool. Engineers are my basic users who address field issues in these applications as well as creating schemes for the projects mentioned. They also use them to in-service equipment and End Point Test it. My apps tend to pull in data sources from larger Edison databases so that my users have live data when they work that is always up to date. I do use Citrix for Microsoft Access applications as they run super quick on Citrix which is a Virtualized Desktop.</p>
         <p class="para">My other duties are Project Manager of NetComm Form Processing which adds new automated devices to the NetComm Database for radio controlled operation. I can even ping radios and controllers of equipment in code to make certain they are operable. </p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>Long Beach City College has courses in Web Development and I have almost completed my second one. In the second course, I learned Responsive Web Design and Technical Documentation along with other CSS Tools. I enjoy making restaurant type webpages as I think that could be a great career! I liked how they looked and how to place images like cards from a deck of cards. That word itself helped me learn both Flexbox and Grid, and I feel proficient at them.</p>
        <p>I also learned Parallax and was able to have a form scroll over a background image where the background image does not move. It was a little tough at first, but I did get it to work. I noted during the course that my websites began to look more professional. The course has given me confidence that with work and 3 more courses, I can become a Web Developer.
